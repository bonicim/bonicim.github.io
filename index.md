Hello my name is [Mark](mailto:markabonicillo@gmail.com). 

I'm a Seattle native, born and raised. I'm also a former marine who's returned back to Seattle after six years of service. 

I practice the martial arts such as Escrima, Goju-Ryu, and boxing. I like to do bodyweight exercises and kettlebells.  
My hobbies include playing the piano, learning about jazz culture and history, and reading non-fiction books in science, tech, psychology, and behavioral economics. 
Currently, my favorite writer is [Cheryl Strayed](http://www.cherylstrayed.com/tiny_beautiful_things_114549.htm){:target="_blank"}.

Like many folks in Seattle, I work in tech. You can view my [resume here](https://standardresume.co/r/markbonicillo){:target="_blank"}.
